# Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it:

 * the 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1),
 * the 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
 * the 5 is (2+3),
 * and so on!

## Using The Golden Ratio to Calculate Fibonacci Numbers
We can calculate any **Fibonacci Number** using the **Golden Ratio**:
```
φ = (1 + 5 ** 0.5) / 2 = 1.618033988749895

Xn = (φ^n − (1−φ)^n) / √5
```
The answer comes out as a whole number, exactly equal to the addition of the previous two terms.
## About Fibonacci The Man
His real name was Leonardo Pisano Bogollo, and he lived between 1170 and 1250 in Italy.

"Fibonacci" was his nickname, which roughly means "Son of Bonacci".

As well as being famous for the Fibonacci Sequence, he helped spread Hindu-Arabic Numerals (like our present numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) through Europe in place of Roman Numerals (I, II, III, IV, V, etc). That has saved us all a lot of trouble! Thank you Leonardo.

### Fibonacci Day

Fibonacci Day is November 23rd, as it has the digits "1, 1, 2, 3" which is part of the sequence. So next Nov 23 let everyone know!
