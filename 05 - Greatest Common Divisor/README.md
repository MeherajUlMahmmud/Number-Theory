# Greatest Common Divisor

The greatest common divisor (GCD), also called the greatest common factor, of two numbers is the largest number that divides them both.

For instance, the greatest common factor of 20 and 15 is 5, since 5 divides both 20 and 15 and no larger number has this property.

The concept is easily extended to sets of more than two numbers: the GCD of a set of numbers is the largest number dividing each of them.

## Applications
The GCD is used for a variety of applications in number theory, particularly in modular arithmetic and thus encryption algorithms such as RSA.

```RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is an algorithm used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages.```

GCD is also used for simpler applications, such as simplifying fractions. This makes the GCD a rather fundamental concept to number theory, and as such a number of algorithms have been discovered to efficiently compute it.

The GCD is traditionally notated as ```gcd(a, b)```, or when the context is clear, simply ```(a, b)```.
