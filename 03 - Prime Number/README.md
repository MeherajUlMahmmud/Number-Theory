# Prime Numbers
A prime number is a number that can only be divided by itself and 1 without remainders.

## What is a prime number?
 * A prime number is a number greater than 1 with only two factors – themselves and 1.

 * A prime number cannot be divided by any other numbers without leaving a remainder.

 * An example of a prime number is 13. It can only be divided by 1 and 13. Dividing a prime number by another number results in numbers left over ```e.g. 13 ÷ 6 = 2 remainder 1. 13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1. 13 ÷ 1 = 13 remainder 0.```

 * 15 is not an example of a prime number because it can be divided by 5 and 3 as well as by itself and 1.

 * 15 is an example of a composite number because it has more than two factors.
