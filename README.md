# Number Theory

```
In the repository I have tried to implement some number theory algorithms, and write a little backstory about them. I hope it helps you.

Don't expect too much, but I will try my best to write it. And don't forget to start the repo. Happy coding. :)

**Number theory**, branch of mathematics concerned with properties of the positive integers (1, 2, 3, …). Sometimes called “higher arithmetic,” it is among the oldest and most natural of mathematical pursuits.

**Number theory** has always fascinated amateurs as well as professional mathematicians. In contrast to other branches of mathematics, many of the problems and theorems of number theory can be understood by laypersons, although solutions to the problems and proofs of the theorems often require a sophisticated mathematical background.

Modern number theory is a broad subject that is classified into subheadings such as **elementary number theory**, **algebraic number theory**, **analytic number theory**, **geometric number theory**, and **probabilistic number theory**. These categories reflect the methods used to address problems concerning the integers.
