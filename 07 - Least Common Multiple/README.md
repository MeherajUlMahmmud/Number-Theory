# Least Common Multiple

The least common multiple is also known as LCM (or) the Lowest Common Multiple in Math. The least common multiple of two or more numbers is the smallest number among all common multiples of the given numbers. Let’s take two numbers: say, 2 and 5. Each will have its own set of multiples. 

```Multiples of 2 are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, …```
```Multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, …```

Here, the common multiples of 2 and 5 are 10, 20, ….. The smallest number among 10, 20, … is 10.

So the least common multiple of 2 and 5 is 10. Therefore, ```LCM (2, 5) = 10```

## How to find the Least Common Multiple?
LCM of numbers can be calculated using various methods. There are 3 methods to find the least common multiple of two numbers. Each method is explained below with some examples of LCM.

 * LCM by Listing Method
 * LCM using Prime Factorization
 * LCM using Division Method

### LCM by Listing Method (Listing Out the Common Multiples)
By using the listing out the common multiples method we can find out the common multiples of two or more numbers. Out of these common multiples, the least common multiple is considered and the LCM of two given numbers can thus be calculated.

To calculate the LCM of the two numbers A and B by using listing out the common multiples follow the steps given below:

 * Step 1 - List a few multiples of A and B
 * Step 2 - Mark the common multiples from the multiples of both numbers.
 * Step 3 - Select the smallest common multiple, that smallest common multiple is the LCM of the two numbers.

```
Example: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 5. 

Solution: Multiples of 4 are: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, ... and the multiples of 5 are: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, ...

LCM of 4 and 5 by listing out common multiples:
4 -> 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, ...
5 -> 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...

Hence, by the definition of least common multiple, the LCM of 4 and 5 is 20
```

### LCM using Prime Factorization
By using the prime factorization method we can find out the prime factors of the numbers and these prime factors can be used to find the LCM of those numbers.

To calculate the LCM of two numbers using the prime factorization method follow the steps given below:

 * Step 1 - Represent the numbers in the prime factored form. 
 * Step 2 - The LCM of the given two numbers is the product of all the prime factors. (However, common factors will be included only once) 

```
Example: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 60 and 90 using prime factorization. 

Solution:

Step 1 - The prime factorization of 60 and 90 are:
    60 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5
    90 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5

Step 2 - The product of all the prime factors,
    2 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 3 = 180.

Therefore, LCM of 60 and 90 by Prime Factorization = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 3 = 180
```

### By Division Method
By the division method, we will divide the numbers by a common prime number, and these dividends are used to calculate the LCM of those numbers.

To calculate the LCM of two numbers using the division method follow the steps given below:

 * Step 1 - Find a prime number which is a factor of at least one of the given numbers. Write this prime number on the left of the two numbers. For each number in the right column, do the following: 
 * Step 2 - If the prime number in step 1 is a factor of the number, then divide the number by the prime and write the quotient below. If the prime number in step 1 is not a factor of the number, then write the number in the row below as it is. Continue the steps until all coprime numbers are left in the last row. (Two numbers are said to be coprime if they share no common factors other than 1.)

```
Example: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 15 using the common division method.

Solution:

Step 1 - 2 is the smallest prime number and it is a factor of 6. 
        Write this prime number on the left of the two numbers.
        For each number in the right column, continue finding out prime numbers which are their factors.

Step 2 - 2 divides 6 but it's not a factor of 15, then write the number 15 in the row below as it is.
        Continue the steps until all coprime numbers are left in the last row. 

Step 3 - The LCM is the product of all the prime numbers.
        Therefore, the LCM of 6 and 15 by division method is, 2 × 3 × 5 = 30. 
```
 
Though we have three methods to find the LCM, the prime factorization method is the most common and easy method that we use.
