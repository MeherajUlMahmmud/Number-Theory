# Factorial !

```
Example: 4! is shorthand for 4 × 3 × 2 × 1
```
	
The factorial function (symbol: !) says to multiply all whole numbers from our chosen number down to 1.
```
Examples:

4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24
7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5040
1! = 1
0! = 1
```
Factorials are calculated over the positive integers. Negative integer factorials are undefined.

Factorials are used in math to calculate the number of permutations of a set of objects.
One area they are used is in Combinations and Permutations.

## Interesting Facts

Six weeks is exactly 10! seconds (3,628,800)

Here is why:

Seconds in 6 weeks:         60 × 60 × 24 × 7 × 6
Factor some numbers:	 (2 × 3 × 10) × (3 × 4 × 5) × (8 × 3) × 7 × 6
Rearrange:	 	2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7 × 8 × 3 × 3 × 10
Lastly 3×3=9:	 	2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7 × 8 × 9 × 10

There are about 60! atoms in the observable Universe.

60! is about 8.320987... × 10^81 and the current estimates are between 10^78 to 10^82 atoms in the observable Universe.

70! is approximately 1.197857... x 10^100,
which is just larger than a Googol
(1 Googol = 1.0 × 10^100 or the digit 1 followed by one hundred zeros).

100! is approximately 9.3326215443944152681699238856 x 10^157

200! is approximately 7.8865786736479050355236321393 x 10^374
